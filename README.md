## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

### What I learned

On this page, a fully functional engineering blog was made in which I learned how to implement an SEO to appear in the first places of Google, in addition to learning how to upload a project to a hosting with its respective domain for track information through Google Analitys. Finally I learned to index each of the pages and integrate a sitemap so that the google robots can identify the pages more quickly.

### Continued development

On this page you could continue developing the implementation of some animations and the integration of google ads.
